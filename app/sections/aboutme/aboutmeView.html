    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>I have spent my undergraduate years at Stanford University combining Computer Science with a concentration in Human Computer Interaction and Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity. I am both passionate and curious about the many ways in which technology and society interact and am excited to explore new arenas and expand my knowledge of technology and development.</p>

    <h2>My Experience</h2>

    <p>I've worn many hats in various adventures often combining interdisciplinary areas of study to push the boundaries between technology and people. I've redesigned websites for a military/government facility, providing updates to their interface and user experience. Recently, I developed a data visualization for a Stanford affiliated geospatial history lab where I was involved in the project from ideation through development with singular control over the code base. Additionally, I spent my time in the Navy ROTC (and other leadership development positions) developing leadership skills for better, more efficient and communicative work styles. I've learned to pick things up quickly, keep an open mind, and indulge a healthy dosage of good-natured curiosity.</p>

    <h2>Where my interests have led me...</h2>

    <p>I'm constantly looking to push my understanding to new levels and take on new challenges. I'm very interested in UI/UX development as well as application/software engineering. Additionally, as my specialty in HCI &amp; my minor in CSRE suggest, I've got a passion for the intersection of technology/invention &amp; innovation and community/society.</p>
